# CS2420-java
This repository contains my work in CS 2420.

Course Overview and Objectives;
This course provides an introduction to tools found throughout computer science â€“ basic algorithmsand data structures that lend themselves naturally to computational problem solving, and engi-neering computational efficiency into programs. Students will gain an understanding of classicalalgorithms (including sorting, searching, tree and graph traversal) and data structures (includinglinked-lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, and heaps). Students will complete extensive programmingassignments that require the implementation and testing of these concepts.

Course was instructed by Swaroop Joshi at the University of Utah.
